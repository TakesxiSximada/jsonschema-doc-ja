"Why doesn't my schema that has a default property actually set the default "

"For an inkling as to *why* it doesn't actually do anything, consider that "
"none of the other validators modify the instance either. More importantly, "
"having :validator:`default` modify the instance can produce quite peculiar "
"things. It's perfectly valid (and perhaps even useful) to have a default "
"that is not valid under the schema it lives in! So an instance modified by "
"the default would pass validation the first time, but fail the second!"

"Still, filling in defaults is a thing that is useful. :mod:`jsonschema` "
"allows you to :doc:`define your own validators <creating>`, so you can "
"easily create a :class:`IValidator` that does do default setting. Here's "
"some code to get you started:"

"See the above-linked document for more info on how this works, but "
"basically, it just extends the :validator:`properties` validator on a "
":class:`Draft4Validator` to then go ahead and update all the defaults."
